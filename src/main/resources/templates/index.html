		<h2>
			<strong>DevOps</strong><em> Development and Operations</em>
		</h2>
		<p class="para">A CI/CD Pipeline implementation, or Continuous
			Integration/Continuous Deployment, is the backbone of the modern
			DevOps environment. It bridges the gap between development and
			operations teams by automating the building, testing, and deployment
			of applications. â€‹</p>
		<p class="para">
			<h3>Why DevOps?</h3></br>
		<ul>
			<li>Shorter Development Cycles, Faster Innovation</li>
			</br>
			<li>Reduced Deployment Failures, Rollbacks, and Time to Recover</li>
			</br>
			<li>Improved Communication and Collaboration</li>
			</br>
			<li>Increased Efficiencies</li>
			</br>
			<li>Reduced Costs and IT Headcount</li>
			</br>
			<li>Stability of Software Development and Deployment</li>
			</br>
		</ul>

<p class="para">
			<h3>The Origin of DevOps Lifecycle ....</h3></br> Before DevOps,
			software applications were developed with either the waterfall model
			or the AGILE development model:
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The waterfall or sequential model</strong> was a pioneering approach
				in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). With this model,
				software development becomes a linear process where different phases
				and tasks are positioned successively.</li>
			</br>
			<li><strong>AGILE software development</strong>, on the other hand, involved the
				use of various approaches and the collaboration of multiple teams in
				SDLC.</li>
		</ul>
		The linearity of the waterfall model and the cross-functionality of
		AGILE software development were still unable to ensure quick and
		continuous delivery of flawless software applications.
